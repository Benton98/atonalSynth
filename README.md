# atonalSynth
Musical synthesis plugin written in C++ using the JUCE framework. This plugin is designed to create pitched instruments out of atonal samples of noise.

# How To Use
This project can be built with the C++ 14 and the JUCE library. It is highly reccomended to build this project using the projucer project manager with either XCode or Visual Studio. This plugin can be exported as a VST3 file and used with most modern Digital Audio Workstations.

# Demo
This the when the peak frequency knob in the plugin is properly key tracked, we are able to create pitched instruments out of just about any sample (footsteps, thunderstorms, etc.). Below I have linked a video demonstration using this plugin with a sample of white noise.
